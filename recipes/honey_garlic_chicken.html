    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>green onion for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>for the sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp sriracha</li>
        <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you haven't already, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, then season it with salt.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a skillet, then add the chicken and cook it until it's cooked through and golden brown on the outside.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, make the sauce: whisk honey, soy sauce, sriracha, and cornstarch together in a glass measuring cup or bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, add the butter and garlic to the skillet and sauté for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, then pour in the sauce and stir until the chicken is coated. If the sauce isn't thickening, turn the heat back up to medium, and if it's thickening too quickly, remove the skillet from the heat and add 1 tablespoon of water to the skillet to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Serve over cooked white rice, top with green onions and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
